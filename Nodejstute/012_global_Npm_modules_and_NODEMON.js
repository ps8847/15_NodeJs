// like in previous 011_npm_module >>> we installed modules and they were only restricted to beb used in that folder obly .. now we will see how to install global modules so that we can use them from anywhere....


// so we will install "nodemon" from npm website and install we will check by "nodemon -v"... it will show error..then we simply  need to follow the below path
// C:\Users\ps789\AppData\Roaming\npm
// and delete the file named as nodemon.ps1

// again come back and type "nodemon -v" .. it will start working



// to check its working.. go to 011_npm and type "nodemon index.js" ... save ...change...repeat.. it will show instant output.....NOW to exit "ctrl + c"
