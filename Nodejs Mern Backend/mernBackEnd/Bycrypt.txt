it will do the encryption

it will use Encryption + hashing  >>  and will generate non readable form of text

it gets 3 years +  to crack this non readable code




what if we use Md5 ? 

go to md5 Online converter >>

convert your text to hashed code 

paste that hashed code in google >>

yeah,,, you are hacker now.


const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

const securePassword = async(password) => {

    // tp incrypt
    const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10) // 10 are rounds
    console.log(passwordHash);

    // to decrypt  (not descypt) >> we will match the password entered with the password stored
    const passwordMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, passwordHash) // 10 are rounds
    console.log(passwordMatch);

}
securePassword("prince@123")
